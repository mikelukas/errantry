Installing Errantry (Mac/Linux)

Beforehand, make sure /usr/local/games is on your $PATH.

Assuming you are in the repository directory:
1) mkdirs /usr/local/share/errantry
2) cp dat /usr/local/share/errantry
3) mkdir /usr/local/share/errantry/bin
4) cp Debug/errantry /usr/local/share/errantry/bin
5) cp scripts/launch_errantry.sh /usr/local/share/errantry/bin
6) chmod +x lau	nch_errantry.sh errantry
7) ln -s /usr/local/share/errantry/bin/launch_errantry.sh /usr/local/games/errantry

The reason for symlinking to launch_errantry.sh instead of directly to the errantry binary is because currently errantry references its dat folder via a hardcoded relative path (../dat).  If the symlink launches errantry directly, this will cause errantry to look for its dat folder in the parent of the symlink, rather than the actual parent of the binary itself.

Hopefully this will be fixed in a later version. =)
